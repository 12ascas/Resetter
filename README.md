# Resetter
It is an application built with python and pyqt that will help to reset an Ubuntu or Linux-Mint system to stock, as if it's been just installed without having to manually re-install by using a live cd/dvd image. It will detect packages that have been installed after the initial system install.

# How to install
Install via deb file. PPA will be created later.
